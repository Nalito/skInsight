### Problem 1: Computer Vision for Skin Defect Diagnosis
During this month, I researched for a suitable problem to build a project on. During my research, I came across the SCIN 
[dataset](https://research.google/blog/scin-a-new-resource-for-representative-dermatology-images/) which contains 10,000+ iamges of dermatology conditions crowdsourced from patients in the US.
I related this to an issue I faced recently; having skin breakouts but not knowing what the cause was or how to treat it. 

A lot of people in Nigeria cannot afford healthcare, talk less of skincare. As at 2022, only less than 5% of Nigerians could afford healthcare insurance. 
In contrast, the Nigerian skincare industry is a growing firm. Last year alone, the Nigerian skincare industry generated over $2 billion in revenue; making it the third 
highest in respect to revenue growth. This growth in the skincare industry does not correlate with the acute deficiency of professioanl dermatologists in the country. 
A lot of Nigerians still buy products based on social media recommendations, and pressure from friends and family. But there is still a major shortage in dermatologists 
in Nigeria (1 for every 1 million Nigerians). 

With the use of AI, people can take pictures of whatever skin issues they are facing and get a diagnosis as well as a drug 
recommendation. This solution can solve the problem of lack of access to quality skincare by:
1. Offering expert recommendations to people who have skin issues or defects
2. Recommending drugs that can be used to treat skin defects
3. Educating users on the importance of skincare
4. Providing users with an affordable and accessible dermatological opinion
